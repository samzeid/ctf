Hey thanks for purchasing my modular industrial scaffolding pack, I hope you enjoy it.
 
This pack includes 7 meshes used to assemble different sizes of scaffolding, 4 of them 
are the different pieces while the other three are used as lowpoly collision meshes. Also 
included are three variant of the same texture, each texture is a different color, red, blue and, yellow. 
There are two materials “Scaffolding_Color” which is used for everything except the top scaffolding piece, while 
“ScaffoldingTop_Color” is only used for the top piece.

PBR texture have been added.
